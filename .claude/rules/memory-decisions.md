## Decisions

<!-- Claude: add new entries at the top -->

- [2026-02-27] Domain aimarketwire.ai — registered and connected to Vercel
- [2026-02-27] Vercel Hobby plan — daily cron (0 0 * * *) for ingestion, hourly requires Pro

- [2026-02-25] Five AI categories at launch (Infrastructure, Regulation, Applications, Chips, Models) — expandable later
- [2026-02-25] Inngest first, BullMQ fallback for background jobs — evaluate during Week 1 implementation
